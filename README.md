### Contents

+ `mv_brm_lmer_R1.R` â€” The main R code file.  
  **Note:** All code lines are commented out, as running the full analyses requires access to high-performance computing infrastructure.  
  For convenience, model results are saved as pre-computed R objects, available from the UBIRA repository (see link below), due to their large size.

### Summary

Data were collected through an eye-tracking experiment involving naturalistic sentence reading in Serbian. A total of 81 native Serbian speakers participated, randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions, each comprising 90 or 66 experimental sentences, along with 5 practice and 30 filler sentences. The materials and design were developed to test syntagmatic and paradigmatic influences on sentence processing.

The data are available from the University of Birmingham Institutional Research Archive (UBIRA):

Files are provided in `.csv` and `.rda` formats.
